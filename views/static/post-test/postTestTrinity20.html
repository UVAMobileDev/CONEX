                <p>The Post Test is a great way to see how much you have improved over the course of QBIT. It is also what we will use for your mathematics placement here at Trinity! Note this is not the same as a knowledge check that some of you have seen as you reach the end of ALEKS. In fact, to take the post test, you need to go to a brand-new ALEKS course that we've set up just for this purpose.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="post_test_list">Here's what you need to do:<br /><br /></p>

                <p class="post_test_list"><img src="https://onexys-smith.herokuapp.com/images/postTest/two_post.svg" alt="two" />You will be asked to take an Initial Knowledge Check.
